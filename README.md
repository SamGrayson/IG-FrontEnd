# IG-FrontEnd

## Sample app for interview.

Summary: 
**Please recreate this page using Angular 2 and NG2Bootstrap.**



The user should be able to type in various input fields. Upon pressing the search button, a bootstrap modal pops up displaying the information the user had previously typed in.

**Dont wory about the styling of the form fields/page as a focus, this is mainly a test of angular and javascript**
